This program utilizes the pygmae module to present he slide show of the images from a specified path.
For the ease purpose i have demostrated the slide show using the file that have .jpg extension.
The name of the images name in the directory are appended into a list.
And this list is passed into the fuction which blits them to screen.
In order to give a slideshow effect i have used the time.wait defaulting to 2 sec, which means every 2 secs the image would be changed.
The user can customise the wait time and the path to their directory.
